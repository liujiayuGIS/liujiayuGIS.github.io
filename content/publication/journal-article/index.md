abstract: "Accurate classification of land cover types is a prerequisite for the protection of natural ecosystems. In particular, understanding the spatial distributions of different vegetation types is essential for the effective management, monitoring, and conservation of forest ecosystems. Satellite remote sensing uses rich spectral band information for land cover classification, but it is usually insufficient for high-precision vegetation classification work in small areas. However, the structure and vegetation information provided by Aerial LiDAR Scanning (ALS) can significantly increase the classification accuracy. To address these limitations, this study utilized high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery and aerial LiDAR point cloud data to improve the accuracy of vegetation classification and plantation observation at the catchment scale. Using Google Earth Engine (GEE), spectral, textural, and LiDAR-derived topographic and vegetation features are extracted and integrated, followed by supervised classification using Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. This approach enhances the accuracy and efficiency of vegetation classification at the catchment scale. The classification results of SVM and RF demonstrated that incorporating LiDAR-derived topographic and vegetation features significantly improved the classification accuracy compared to using spectral and textural features only. Specifically, the overall accuracy (OA) of the RF classification increased from 94.37% to 99.36%, while the kappa coefficient improved from 91.08% to 99.01%. Moreover, the impact threshold analysis based on SHAP values showed that canopy height, tree density, and elevation were the top three key features driving the improvement in the classification performance. This study offers new insights and methods for vegetation classification in complex ecological environments."
summary: "This study uses UAV and LiDAR data with interpretable machine learning to improve vegetation classification accuracy."

abstract: "Gaining an understanding of the intricate mechanisms between human activity and the built environment can help in promoting sustainable urban development. However, most scholars have focused on residents’ life and work behavior and have ignored the third activity (e.g., shopping, eating, and entertainment). In this study, a random forest algorithm and SHapley Additive exPlanation model were utilized to explore the nonlinear influence of the built environment on the attraction of the third activity (other than home and work). A comparative analysis of the inflow of the third activity from home and work was also carried out. The results show that the contributions of all built environment variables to the attraction of the third activity differ between home–other flow (HO) and work–other flow (WO) at the global scale, but their local effects are significantly similar. Furthermore, the nonlinear influence of the built environment on the attractions of the third activity can vary from one factor to another. A significant spatial heterogeneity can be observed on the built environment variables’ local effects on the attractions of the third activity. These findings can provide urban planners with insights that will help in the planning and optimization of communities for pursuing the third activity."

abstract: "Recently, several big cities have been faced with rapid expansion of the population in China, ultimately leading to unprecedented pressure on urban healthcare facilities. Thus, new healthcare facilities are established to meet residents’ increasing demand for healthcare. Under the current circumstances, an essential task was to evaluate the improvement of these new facilities to residents’ healthcare accessibility. In this study, the rapid development city of Xi’an, China was employed as the case study, and the Gaussian-based 2SFCA method was utilized to measure the spatial distribution of high-level healthcare accessibility by private cars and public transit. The change in accessibility could be obtained by quantifying the difference in accessibility before and after establishment of the new hospitals. Furthermore, the improvement in equity in healthcare accessibility was measured using the Gini coefficient. Finally, the contribution of each new hospital to healthcare accessibility was evaluated from the perspectives of population coverage, average improvement of each bed, and improvement of the Gini coefficient. The results show that the areas with significant improvement are scalloped to the periphery of the study area, especially in the communities near the new hospitals. What’s more, a slight improvement could also be observed in the equity of healthcare accessibility after the construction of the new hospitals. These results could provide guidance for optimizing and allocating healthcare facilities."
