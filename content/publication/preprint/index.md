abstract: "Gaining an understanding of the intricate mechanisms between human activity and the built environment can help in promoting sustainable urban development. However, most scholars have focused on residents’ life and work behavior and have ignored the third activity (e.g., shopping, eating, and entertainment). In this study, a random forest algorithm and SHapley Additive exPlanation model were utilized to explore the nonlinear influence of the built environment on the attraction of the third activity (other than home and work). A comparative analysis of the inflow of the third activity from home and work was also carried out. The results show that the contributions of all built environment variables to the attraction of the third activity differ between home–other flow (HO) and work–other flow (WO) at the global scale, but their local effects are significantly similar. Furthermore, the nonlinear influence of the built environment on the attractions of the third activity can vary from one factor to another. A significant spatial heterogeneity can be observed on the built environment variables’ local effects on the attractions of the third activity. These findings can provide urban planners with insights that will help in the planning and optimization of communities for pursuing the third activity."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "This study uses a random forest algorithm and SHAP model to explore the nonlinear influence of the built environment on attracting 'third activities' (e.g., shopping, entertainment). By comparing activity flows from home and work, the research reveals complex, spatially heterogeneous relationships that can inform better urban planning."
